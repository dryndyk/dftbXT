The examples of calculations for 1D system.

C25/01_input/output_contacts    - Pre-calculation of electrode parameters.
C25/02_input/output_LDOS_T      - Local DOS and Transmission at zero volatge.
C25/03_input/output_IV          - Current-voltage curves with fixed geometry.

The input files include many possible alteranive/additional options.
One can use it to check different possibilities.
