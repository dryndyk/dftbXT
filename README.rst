DFTB+: general package for performing fast atomistic calculations
********************************************************************************

DFTB+ is a software package for carrying out fast quantum mechanical
atomistic calculations based on the Density Functional Tight Binding
method. The most recent features are described `here
<https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5143190>`_. It can be either used as a
standalone program or integrated into other software packages as a
library.

The project is hosted on `github <http://github.com/dftbplus/dftbplus>`_.
