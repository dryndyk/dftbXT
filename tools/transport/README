  UTILITIES TO BUILD STRUCTURES FOR TRANSPORT CALCULATIONS
************************************************************

buildwire
----------
   
   It is used to replicate a Principal layer (PL) a number
of times. The program also orders the contact in the right
way and output numbers to be used for geometry and for 
FirstLayerAtoms. 
It is an interactive program that asks some inputs. 
Provide a .gen file that describes the PL unit including
supercell vectors.

Typical program output:

 Insert PL .gen file name: 
$ pl.gen
 Insert direction (e.g. 0 0 1)
$ 0 0 1
 Insert number of PLs in channel: 
$ 10

 structure built
 *iatc=
         881        1056 0
        1057        1232 0
 *PLs=
     1    89   177   265   353   441   529   617   705   793;

The final output in this case is Ordered_pl.gen
------------------------------------------------------------

contacts
--------

    This is used to manipulate an existing structure and prepare
it for transport calculations. A typical example is a structure
contact-molecule-contact,

   --  --
   --oo--
   --  --

that need to be reordered for dftb+. The code can also build from
one PL the 2 replicated PLs needed by the code. 
NOTES: The code assumes the transport direction along z. 
       Supercell structures are changed into Clusters

Example. 

  $ contacts
  Usage: contacts filein.gen start1 end1 npl1 latt_vect1 start2 end2 npl2 latt_vect2
 
  $ contacts struct.gen 1 200 2 -2.52948 341 540 2 2.52948 

This will consider the first 200 atoms as the first PL of contact 1 and
replicate it 2 times in the negative z-direction so for the second contact
it will be replicated 2-times in the positive z. The final structure contains
940 atoms.
